# solana-academy

The idea is to have a school centered upon on NFTs and NFT permissions. Students join the school and are awarded an NFT. This NFT acts as their Student ID and their source of permissions. The ID NFT will allow them to register for classes or receive school books (represented as other NFTs).

## Proposed Features

[ ] Soulbond NFT (Student ID)

[ ] Token-gated access to content

[ ] Dynamic metadata (Attendance, Grades, etc)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node v18.18.0 or higher

- Rust v1.77.2 or higher
- Anchor CLI 0.30.0 or higher
- Solana CLI 1.18.9 or higher

### Installation

#### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

#### Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

#### Start the web app

```
npm run dev
```

## Apps

### anchor

This is a Solana program written in Rust using the Anchor framework.

#### Commands

You can use any normal anchor commands. Either move to the `anchor` directory and run the `anchor` command or prefix the command with `npm run`, eg: `npm run anchor`.

#### Sync the program id:

Running this command will create a new keypair in the `anchor/target/deploy` directory and save the address to the Anchor config file and update the `declare_id!` macro in the `./src/lib.rs` file of the program.

You will manually need to update the constant in `anchor/lib/basic-exports.ts` to match the new program id.

```shell
npm run anchor keys sync
```

#### Build the program:

```shell
npm run anchor-build
```

#### Start the test validator with the program deployed:

```shell
npm run anchor-localnet
```

#### Run the tests

```shell
npm run anchor-test
```

#### Deploy to Devnet

```shell
npm run anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### web

This is a React app that uses the Anchor generated client to interact with the Solana program.

#### Commands

Start the web app

```shell
npm run dev
```

Build the web app

```shell
npm run build
```
